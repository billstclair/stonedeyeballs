# StonedEyeballs.com

This page started out as the single "Stoned Eyeballs" image. It has
grown considerably, and the Elm code that runs it is shared with FotoJSON.com.

To upload the code to StonedEyeballs.com, `bin/update-site`.

To create your own FotoJSON based site, copy the `site` directory, including all the fotojson.com code, and changing the rest as you wish.

`bin/update-site` uses the `rsyncit` script from [github.com/billstclair/wws-scripts](https://github.com/billstclair/wws-scripts).
