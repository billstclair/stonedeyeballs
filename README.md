# StonedEyeballs.com

This page started out as the single "Stoned Eyeballs" image. It has
grown considerably, and is now primarily an example of how I build
user interface code.

StonedEyeballs.com now runs the code from FotoJSON.com, loaded with its own initial images.

It currently works only in the Apache web server, due to its use of .htaccess reverse proxies. I invite pull requests making it work in other web servers, especially Nginx.

To upload the code to StonedEyeballs.com, `bin/update-site`.
