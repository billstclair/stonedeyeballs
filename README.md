# StonedEyeballs.com

This page started out as the single "Stoned Eyeballs" image. It has
grown considerably, and is now primarily an example of how I build
user interface code.

To compile the Elm code into JavaScript in `site/elm.js`:

    bin/build
    
Do development by starting `elm reactor` in the `stonedeyeballs`
directory, then aiming your browser at
http://localhost:8000/site/index.html. Each time you build, you can
full-reload the browser tab.

To upload the code to stoned-eyeballs.com, `bin/update-site`.
